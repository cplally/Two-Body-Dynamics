Two-Body Dynamics

=================

This is a Python program to simulate the dynamics of a gravitational
two-body system. It depends on scipy, and is run by calling the function
two_body_sim (with appropriate arguments).

Please note that this simulation uses S.I. units; the supplied parameters must
be given in terms of meters, kilograms, and seconds.
